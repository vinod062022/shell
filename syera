Reddy was born to the chief of Uyyalawada and his two wives who are the daughters of Nossam's chief. 
He defied death after being born still and coming to life, and is believed to be blessed by God with gifted abilities and has demonstrated athletic and acrobatic skills from a young age.
 One day, a teenage Reddy rides past an execution conducted by the British, and his grandfather explains the predicament faced by villagers under the rule of the East India Company. 
Reddy vows to retaliate and learns combat and philosophy under sage Gosayi Venkanna. 
25 years later, Reddy gathers several fallen chiefs and kings from different provinces and organizes a fully operational resistance in the city of Renadu. 
The kingdoms were taken over by British forces led by Cochrane, the governor of Madras. 
Cochrane is told of Reddy's resistance being ef
fective against their rule and sends a general named Jackson to forcefully collect Renadu's taxes.
